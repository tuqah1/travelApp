# travel application

This project is a web travel application. It’s common to pull basic data from an API, but many applications don’t just pull the weather, they pull in multiple types of data, from different sources and occasionally one API will be required to get data from another API.
This Travel Planner application allows users to plan their trips by entering the destination and the departure date. The app integrates with multiple APIs to provide weather forecasts and images for the destination.
